# UML BPF Kernel Patches

These patches are applied to the bpf-next kernel tree after checkout to enable
BPF verification on User Mode Linux (UML). They are applied by `build.sh`
automatically using `git am` (idempotent: already-applied patches are skipped).

## Patches

### 0001 — `um/x86: add __x64_sys_* wrappers for BPF selftest compatibility`

**Problem:** BPF selftests compiled for x86-64 use the `__x64_` syscall prefix
when attaching `fentry`/`kprobe`/`raw_tp` programs (controlled by `SYS_PREFIX`
in `bpf_misc.h`). On native x86-64 kernels, `ARCH_HAS_SYSCALL_WRAPPER`
generates a real `asmlinkage long __x64_sys_<name>(const struct pt_regs *regs)`
function for every syscall. These functions appear in the kernel BTF as
`BTF_KIND_FUNC` entries, which libbpf resolves at BPF object open time.

UML does not use syscall wrappers, so these BTF entries are absent and libbpf
fails with `-ESRCH` when trying to resolve the attach target.

**Fix:** Add minimal `__x64_sys_*` wrapper functions for the five syscalls that
BPF selftests reference via `SYS_PREFIX`: `getpgid`, `nanosleep`, `prctl`,
`prlimit64`, and `setdomainname`. Each wrapper has the canonical x86-64 syscall
wrapper signature so pahole emits the correct `BTF_KIND_FUNC` entry. Arguments
are extracted using `UPT_SYSCALL_ARGn()` macros.

**Files changed:**
- `arch/x86/um/x64_syscall_wrappers.c` (new)
- `arch/x86/um/Makefile` (add `x64_syscall_wrappers.o`)

### 0002 — `bpf: add UML verification stubs for kernels without perf events`

**Problem:** `CONFIG_BPF_EVENTS` depends on `PERF_EVENTS` and
`KPROBE_EVENTS`/`UPROBE_EVENTS`. On UML these hardware-dependent subsystems are
unavailable, so `BPF_PROG_TYPE_KPROBE`, `TRACEPOINT`, `PERF_EVENT`,
`RAW_TRACEPOINT`, `RAW_TRACEPOINT_WRITABLE`, and `TRACING` are not registered.
`BPF_PROG_LOAD` returns `-EINVAL` for these types, causing veristat to report
failures for all tracing-type BPF programs.

Similarly, `BPF_MAP_TYPE_STACK_TRACE` is not registered and the
`bpf_get_stackid()`/`bpf_get_stack()` helpers are unavailable, causing veristat
to fail on programs that use stack trace maps (`pyperf*`, `strobemeta*`,
`stacktrace_*`).

Also, `bpf_trace_printk()` and `bpf_trace_vprintk()` are normally provided by
`kernel/trace/bpf_trace.c`, which is compiled under `CONFIG_BPF_EVENTS`. UML's
verification-only config intentionally has no `BPF_EVENTS`, so the weak
`bpf_get_trace_printk_proto()`/`bpf_get_trace_vprintk_proto()` fallbacks return
`NULL`. That makes otherwise valid `bpf_printk()` users fail during verification
with `program of this type cannot use helper bpf_trace_printk#6`.

**Fix:** Add hidden UML-only verification stub configs:

- `CONFIG_BPF_VERIFICATION_STUBS`, available only for UML kernels with
  `BPF_SYSCALL`, `BPF_JIT`, and no `PERF_EVENTS`/`BPF_EVENTS`
- `CONFIG_BPF_LSM_VERIFICATION_STUBS`, additionally gated on `CONFIG_SECURITY`
  so LSM program/map types are only advertised when the matching stub symbols
  are compiled

Together these configs:

1. Provides minimal `bpf_verifier_ops` and `bpf_prog_ops` for all six tracing
   program types, using a `DEFINE_STUB_OPS()` macro to eliminate boilerplate.
   The stubs delegate to `bpf_base_func_proto()` for helper access and
   `bpf_tracing_btf_ctx_access()` for context type checking.

2. Compiles `stackmap.c` and provides stub callchain buffer functions so
   `BPF_MAP_TYPE_STACK_TRACE` maps can be created. The execution-time stubs
   use `WARN_ON_ONCE` since veristat never runs programs.

3. Registers `BPF_MAP_TYPE_STACK_TRACE` in `bpf_types.h` under
   `CONFIG_BPF_VERIFICATION_STUBS`, mirroring the existing
   `CONFIG_PERF_EVENTS` guard.

4. Provides verification-only `bpf_trace_printk()` and `bpf_trace_vprintk()`
   helper prototypes. The stubs return `-EOPNOTSUPP` if ever executed; they
   exist only so veristat can validate programs that call `bpf_printk()`.

5. Registers `BPF_PROG_TYPE_LSM`, `BPF_MAP_TYPE_INODE_STORAGE`, BPF LSM attach
   target symbols, and selected LSM kfunc BTF entries only when
   `CONFIG_BPF_LSM_VERIFICATION_STUBS` is enabled.

**Files changed:**
- `kernel/bpf/bpf_verification_stubs.c` (new — stub ops + callchain/LSM stubs)
- `kernel/bpf/Kconfig` (add hidden verification stub configs)
- `kernel/bpf/Makefile` (add `bpf_verification_stubs.o`, compile `stackmap.o`)
- `kernel/bpf/stackmap.c` (guard perf_event-specific functions)
- `include/linux/bpf_types.h` (register tracing/stack/LSM types under the stub
  configs)
- `include/linux/perf_event.h` (declare callchain stub symbols)

**Result:** veristat can verify tracing program types, stack-trace users, and
`bpf_printk()` users on UML kernels that deliberately do not enable
`CONFIG_BPF_EVENTS`. This also keeps arena spin-lock diagnostics intact while
allowing `arena_spin_lock.bpf.o` to pass under `uml-veristat`.

### 0003 — `um: fix stub binary page alignment by removing -Wl,-n`

**Problem:** The UML stub binary was built with `-Wl,-n` in
`STUB_EXE_LDFLAGS`, which creates a non-demand-paged (OMAGIC) ELF output.
This causes the stub's LOAD segments to have `Align=0x8` instead of the
required `Align=0x1000` (page size). UML's `map_stub_pages()` requires
page-aligned LOAD segments and fails to boot with `mmap stub_exe` errors
when the alignment is wrong.

**Fix:** Remove `-Wl,-n` from `STUB_EXE_LDFLAGS` so the stub binary gets
page-aligned LOAD segments.

**Files changed:**
- `arch/um/kernel/skas/Makefile` (remove `-Wl,-n` from `STUB_EXE_LDFLAGS`)

---

### 0003b — `um/x86: enable eBPF JIT support and default-on JIT for UML`

**Problem:** `CONFIG_BPF_JIT` cannot be enabled on UML x86-64 because
`HAVE_EBPF_JIT` was not selected for the architecture. Without
`CONFIG_BPF_JIT=y`, `register_bpf_struct_ops()` returns `-EOPNOTSUPP`
immediately, so all struct_ops BPF programs (tcp congestion control, etc.)
fail to load. UML x86-64 can in fact use the x86-64 BPF JIT since it runs
as a regular Linux process on an x86-64 host.

**Fix:** Add:
- `select HAVE_EBPF_JIT if 64BIT` so `CONFIG_BPF_JIT=y` can be enabled
- `select ARCH_WANT_DEFAULT_BPF_JIT if 64BIT` so 64-bit UML boots with
  `net.core.bpf_jit_enable=1` by default, matching native x86-64

**Files changed:**
- `arch/x86/um/Kconfig`

---

### 0003c — `um/x86: wire up native x86 BPF JIT backend for UML`

**Problem:** After enabling `CONFIG_BPF_JIT` for UML x86-64, the kernel still
uses the weak generic BPF JIT stubs from `kernel/bpf/core.c`. UML's build path
does not link `arch/x86/net/`, where the real x86 BPF JIT backend lives, so
helpers like `bpf_jit_supports_kfunc_call()` keep returning `false`. This makes
kfunc-using programs fail with `JIT does not support calling kernel function`
even though JIT is enabled.

`arch/x86/net/bpf_jit_comp.c` also assumes native x86 support headers, ptregs
layout, text patching, mitigation, NOP, and per-cpu runtime symbols that UML
does not provide. For `uml-veristat`, these paths only need to support
load-time verifier and JIT analysis; generated code is not executed inside the
UML guest.

UML's `text_poke()` implementation is also a warning stub. Without a UML-local
copy path, final JIT image installation emits noisy stack traces during
otherwise successful verbose-mode verification runs.

1. Export native x86 NOP and vsyscall definitions through UML `asm/` wrappers.
2. Provide the selector constants used by x86 speculation helpers.
3. Teach the JIT's `pt_regs` fixup table to use UML's `regs.gp[]` layout.
4. Provide the missing cpufeature mask fallbacks.
5. Provide UML-local verification-only shims for NOP tables, CFI mode,
   `text_poke_set()`, `smp_text_poke_single()`, `clear_bhb_loop()`, and
   `this_cpu_off`.
6. Route UML around native retpoline/BHB machinery that requires native x86
   thunk symbols.
7. Use a direct `memcpy()` for final JIT image copies on UML instead of routing
   through UML's warning-only `text_poke()` stub.

**Fix:** Link `arch/x86/net/` into `arch/x86/Makefile.um` and add the minimal
UML/x86 compatibility glue needed for `bpf_jit_comp.c` to build and link under
`ARCH=um`. Keeping the wiring and runtime shims together avoids an intermediate
patch that enables the native backend but leaves the UML kernel unbuildable.

**Result:** The full UML kernel links, and `bpf_jit_supports_kfunc_call()`
returns true in the final `linux` binary. Kfunc-using objects like
`test_send_signal_kern.bpf.o` and `xfrm_info.bpf.o` get past the old
`JIT does not support calling kernel function` failure and now fail later in
normal verifier/codegen paths. Verbose-mode runs no longer print spurious
`WARNING: arch/um/kernel/um_arch.c` / `text_poke+...` stack traces for normal
successful BPF verification.

**Files changed:**
- `arch/um/include/asm/cpufeature.h`
- `arch/x86/Makefile.um`
- `arch/x86/net/bpf_jit_comp.c`
- `arch/x86/um/asm/nops.h` (new)
- `arch/x86/um/asm/segment.h`
- `arch/x86/um/asm/vsyscall.h` (new)

### 0004 — `selftests/bpf: fix bpf_testmod.c compilation on UML`

**Problem:** `bpf_testmod.c` fails to compile as a kernel module when `ARCH=um`
due to two architecture-guard issues:

1. **`VSYSCALL_ADDR` undeclared** (line ~408): The surrounding code is guarded
   by `#ifdef CONFIG_X86_64`, which is defined on UML x86-64. However, UML's
   `asm/` include path goes through `arch/um/` rather than `arch/x86/`, so
   `<asm/vsyscall.h>` is not available and `VSYSCALL_ADDR` is undefined.

2. **`struct pt_regs` missing named fields** (lines ~607-617): The uprobe
   handler is guarded by `#ifdef __x86_64__` (a compiler macro). Since UML
   compiles as x86-64 userspace, `__x86_64__` is defined by GCC. But UML's
   `struct pt_regs` wraps a `uml_pt_regs` with a `gp[]` array, not the named
   fields `.cx`, `.ax`, `.r11` that the uprobe handler accesses.

**Fix:** Change the two guards to also exclude UML:
- `#if defined(CONFIG_X86_64) && !defined(CONFIG_UML)` for the vsyscall block
- `#if defined(__x86_64__) && !defined(CONFIG_UML)` for the uprobe handler block

The excluded code paths are non-functional on UML anyway (no vsyscall page, no
uprobe hardware support), so excluding them has no effect on verification
coverage.

**Files changed:**
- `tools/testing/selftests/bpf/test_kmods/bpf_testmod.c` (two guard changes)

### 0005 — `libbpf: tolerate duplicate base BTF candidates in relocation`

**Problem:** `btf__relocate()` maps distilled base BTF type IDs to the real
base BTF type IDs. Distilled base BTF intentionally keeps only name and size
for named composite types, because that is enough to rewrite split BTF
references back to the target base BTF.

Some base BTFs can still contain duplicate compatible named types. When one
distilled base type matches more than one compatible base candidate, the current
code treats the second candidate as fatal and rejects the whole relocation,
even though the distilled representation cannot observe a difference between
those candidates.

On UML this shows up while loading `bpf_testmod.ko`: duplicate vmlinux BTF
candidates prevent `bpf_testmod.ko`'s BTF from being registered in
`/sys/kernel/btf/bpf_testmod`.

Without `/sys/kernel/btf/bpf_testmod`, libbpf cannot find the module BTF when loading
any BPF program that references types from `bpf_testmod` (struct_ops, kfuncs, etc.),
and veristat fails with `-3 ESRCH` at the file level for all such programs.

**Fix:** Keep the first compatible base candidate for a distilled type and
ignore later compatible duplicates. Preserve the existing ambiguity check in
the other direction: if one base candidate matches multiple distilled base
types, the distilled base itself is ambiguous and relocation still fails.

This patch deliberately does not relax CO-RE relocation ambiguity. For
`BPF_CORE_TYPE_ID_TARGET`, the selected BTF ID is the relocated value, so
different target IDs remain observable and are handled separately in `0005b`.

**Files changed:**
- `tools/lib/bpf/btf_relocate.c` (keep first compatible duplicate base candidate)
- `tools/testing/selftests/bpf/prog_tests/btf_distill.c` (duplicate base-candidate
  coverage for primitive and struct cases)

**Result:** `bpf_testmod.ko` can register module BTF on UML despite duplicate
compatible base candidates, unblocking the module-backed selftests that
previously failed at object-open time with `-3 ESRCH`.

### 0005b — `libbpf: tolerate duplicate target type IDs in CO-RE relocation`

**Problem:** CO-RE `BPF_CORE_TYPE_ID_TARGET` relocations can see multiple
compatible target candidates in kernel BTF. For example, UML vmlinux BTF can
contain duplicate compatible `struct sockaddr_un` definitions. Field-offset
relocations can still verify that all candidates produce the same offset, but
`TYPE_ID_TARGET` returns a raw BTF ID, so otherwise compatible candidates appear
as an ambiguity even when either ID would be valid for `bpf_rdonly_cast()`.

**Fix:** In `relo_core.c`, keep the first non-poisoned candidate for
`BPF_CORE_TYPE_ID_TARGET` and skip later compatible candidates that only differ
by target type ID. Other relocation kinds keep the existing ambiguity checks.

**Files changed:**
- `tools/lib/bpf/relo_core.c`

## Patch 0006 — bpf: preallocate arena range-tree nodes in sleepable paths

**Files:** `kernel/bpf/arena.c`, `kernel/bpf/range_tree.c`,
`kernel/bpf/range_tree.h`

**Problem:** After veristat preserves arena maps' required zero `key_size` and
`value_size`, arena objects reach kernel map creation but can fail before any
real arena verifier work happens. Arena maps track free pages in a
`range_tree`, and runtime range-tree updates use `kmalloc_nolock()` because
they can run under `arena->spinlock`.

Two sleepable arena paths can also need a new `range_node`:

1. `arena_map_alloc()` seeds the empty tree with the full free range.
2. `arena_vm_fault()` can split a free range when libbpf mmap()s the arena and
   copies initial `__arena` data into the mapping.

On UML, `kmalloc_nolock()` can fail in both places. The first case returns
`-ENOMEM` from map creation. The second case returns `VM_FAULT_SIGSEGV` while
copying arena globals through the user VMA.

**Fix:** Add allocation ownership to `range_node` so nodes allocated from
sleepable paths are freed with `kfree()`. Use `range_tree_init_full()` to seed
the initial full range with one `GFP_KERNEL_ACCOUNT` node in normal sleepable
context. Add `range_tree_clear_with_node()` and let `arena_vm_fault()`
preallocate one split node before retaking `arena->spinlock`.

Existing runtime callers keep using `range_tree_clear()` and
`range_tree_set()` unchanged, preserving the `kmalloc_nolock()` behavior for
normal arena mutations.

**Impact:** Arena maps can be created on UML, and arena objects with global
data at non-edge offsets now process normally, including `arena_htab.bpf.o`,
`arena_spin_lock.bpf.o`, and `verifier_arena_globals1.bpf.o`.

## Patch 0007 — selftests/bpf: make benchmark map definitions standalone-loadable

**Files:**
- `tools/testing/selftests/bpf/progs/bloom_filter_bench.c`
- `tools/testing/selftests/bpf/progs/bpf_hashmap_lookup.c`
- `tools/testing/selftests/bpf/progs/htab_mem_bench.c`

**Problem:** Benchmark programs (`bloom_filter_bench`, `bpf_hashmap_lookup`,
`htab_mem_bench`) intentionally let their userspace benchmark harnesses resize
and retune maps before loading. As raw `.bpf.o` inputs, though, those maps can
have zero `key_size`, `value_size`, or `max_entries`, so standalone loaders such
as `veristat` fail in `BPF_MAP_CREATE` before the verifier sees any program.

**Fix:** Give the benchmark maps small valid defaults:
- `bloom_filter_bench`: default `value_size` and `max_entries` for the array
  and bloom filter maps, and default `key_size`, `value_size`, and
  `max_entries` for the hash map.
- `bpf_hashmap_lookup`: default hash map key size, value size, and entry count.
- `htab_mem_bench`: default hash map value size and entry count.

The benchmark harnesses still call `bpf_map__set_*()` before load, so runtime
benchmark behavior remains configurable.

**Impact:** Fixes `bloom_filter_bench.bpf.o`, `bpf_hashmap_lookup.bpf.o`, and
`htab_mem_bench.bpf.o` (3 files, `-EINVAL`) without requiring veristat to guess
map dimensions.

---

## Patch 0007b — selftests/bpf: veristat: preserve zero max_entries for percpu cgroup storage

**File:** `tools/testing/selftests/bpf/veristat.c`

**Problem:** Veristat's `fixup_obj_maps()` sets `max_entries = 1` for most maps
whose object metadata leaves `max_entries` at zero. It already excludes cgroup
storage maps because they require `max_entries == 0`, but it missed
`BPF_MAP_TYPE_PERCPU_CGROUP_STORAGE`, which has the same requirement. Rewriting
that field produces false `BPF_MAP_CREATE -EINVAL` file-level failures.

**Fix:** Add `BPF_MAP_TYPE_PERCPU_CGROUP_STORAGE` to the max-entries fixup
exclusion list.

**Impact:** Fixes percpu cgroup storage users such as `map_ptr_kern.bpf.o`,
`netcnt_prog.bpf.o`, `percpu_alloc_array.bpf.o`,
`tailcall_cgrp_storage*.bpf.o`, and `verifier_cgroup_storage.bpf.o`.

---

## Patch 0008 — selftests/bpf: veristat: cap auto log size to avoid OOM

**File:** `tools/testing/selftests/bpf/veristat.c`

**Problem:** Veristat probes whether the kernel accepts "big" verifier log
buffers and, if it does, defaults to `UINT_MAX >> 2` for verbose mode. On UML
this is roughly 1 GiB, which exceeds the guest's default memory size and can
make `veristat -vl2` crash before it prints any verifier log output.

**Fix:** Keep the existing probe, but cap the automatically chosen default log
size to 64 MiB. Users can still request a larger buffer explicitly with
`--log-size`.

**Impact:** Prevents verbose-mode crashes in UML while preserving explicit
large-log opt-in behavior.

## Verification Notes

`uml-veristat` is validating two things at once:

1. generic verifier correctness
2. UML/x86 backend support for lowering the verified program

The kernel does not separate those into two visible phases. Instead, the
verifier directly consults JIT/backend capability hooks such as:

- `bpf_jit_supports_kfunc_call()`
- `bpf_jit_supports_far_kfunc_call()`
- `bpf_jit_supports_arena()`
- `bpf_jit_supports_insn(..., true)`
- `bpf_jit_supports_percpu_insn()`
- `bpf_jit_supports_subprog_tailcalls()`
- `bpf_jit_supports_private_stack()`
- `bpf_jit_supports_exceptions()`
- `bpf_jit_supports_fsession()`
- `bpf_jit_supports_ptr_xchg()`
- `bpf_jit_supports_timed_may_goto()`

Arena is the most important example for this patch stack. Upstream verifier code
rejects `BPF_MAP_TYPE_ARENA` unless JIT is requested and the backend reports
arena support. That is because arena accesses are not plain generic memory
operations; they rely on JIT-specific lowering of arena pointers and
`BPF_PROBE_MEM32`/`BPF_PROBE_MEM32SX` fixups.

For `uml-veristat`, this means some failures are best read as:

- the program is semantically valid BPF, but
- current UML/x86 JIT support is incomplete for that feature

That distinction matters when evaluating remaining failures and deciding
whether a fix belongs in:

- generic verifier logic
- UML/JIT backend support
- selftest harness assumptions
