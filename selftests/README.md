# UML BPF Selftests

This directory preserves the original repository purpose: building and running
Linux BPF selftests inside User-Mode Linux.

It is no longer the primary surface of the repository. The main product is now
[`uml-veristat`](../README.md).
Selftests remain here as reference infrastructure, regression context, and
supporting research material.

## Contents

- [`run_bpf_uml.sh`](run_bpf_uml.sh)
  is the original reproducible selftests build-and-run script.
- [`patches/`](patches) contains the
  fault-injection handling patches for graceful `-ENOMEM` behavior.
- [`artifacts/reference/`](artifacts/reference)
  contains preserved reference outputs and result summaries.
- [`fault-injection/`](fault-injection)
  contains the failslab harness, init script, and analysis outputs.

## Compatibility

The root-level `./run_bpf_uml.sh`, `./bpf_failslab_test.sh`, and
`./init_failslab` paths still work and forward here.
